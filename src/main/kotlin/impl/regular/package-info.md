From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_tilings_by_convex_regular_polygons#regular_tilings)
> Following GrÃ¼nbaum and Shephard, a tiling is said to be regular
> if the symmetry group of the tiling acts transitively on the flags of the tiling,
> where a flag is a triple consisting of a mutually incident vertex, edge and tile of the tiling.
> This means that, for every pair of flags, there is a symmetry operation mapping the first flag to the second.
> This is equivalent to the tiling being an edge-to-edge tiling by congruent regular polygons.
> There must be six equilateral triangles, four squares or three regular hexagons at a vertex,
> yielding the three regular tessellations.
